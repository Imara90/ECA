% A Direct Bitstream Manipulation Approach for Virtex4-based Evolvable Systems
\label{sec:virtex4}

In \cite{virtex4} and \cite{PDR} a Virtex-4 FPGA implementation is introduced for evolvable systems. Other then earlier versions of Virtex (e.g. the Virtex-II Pro), Virtex4 devices enable two-dimensional dynamic reconfiguration, a feature which considerably reduces the reconfiguration time and thus the evolution time \cite{virtex4}. A big limitation of Virtex FPGAs is an almost unknown and undocumented bitstream data format and an unsafe configurations schema. By using both Virtual Reconfigurable Circuits (VRCs) and direct bitstream manipulation, this architecture eliminates this limitation. This Virtex-4 based device, which takes advantage of 2D reconfiguration capabilities and direct manipulation of the bitstreams is the first one of its kind and will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:candidate}.
