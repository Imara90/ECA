\subsection{Proposed Hardware}
\label{sec:hardware}

The architecture introduced in \cite{PDR} seems the most promising architecture. Whereas \cite{virtex4} is still discovering the two-dimensional reconfigurability using rigid columns with static routing, \cite{PDR} is applying \emph{Partial Dynamically Reconfiguration}, enabling the system to reconfigure certain parts while others keep running their program. Keeping the idea of evolvable systems in mind, this feature enables an \emph{autonomic system} best. Also, the designers have used their one drawback (the addition of an enhanced ICAP) to include two more system improvements concerning the speed up. 

A quantative comparison between all three the hardware implementations will be covered in section \ref{sec:related}.
