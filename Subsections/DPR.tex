% A Fast Reconfigurable 2D HW Core Archtiecture on FPGAs for Evolvable Self-Adaptive Systms

A second Virtex-4 based architecture introduced in \cite{dpr} also applies a 2D reconfiguration core. Rather than direct bitstream manipulation, an optimized Dynamically and Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) control engine has been integrated. As a result, the processing elements (PEs) of the reconfigurable core are structured as a 2D systolic array, known for its high performance and restrained use of resources. Also, the reconfiguration engine has been optimized by applying three enhancements that will be discussed in \ref{sec:dpr}.
