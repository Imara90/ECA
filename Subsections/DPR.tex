% A Fast Reconfigurable 2D HW Core Archtiecture on FPGAs for Evolvable Self-Adaptive Systms

Another FPGA-based architecture is proposed in \cite{dpr}. A highly regular and modular architecture is being integrated with a widely known 2D systolic processing architecture with an optimized DPR control engine. In the design, the processing elements (PEs) of the reconfigurable core are structured as a 2D systolic array, known for its high performance and restrained use of resources (for collection of processed data only the lowest and rightmost PE has to be considered).

Also, the reconfiguration engine has been enhanced by applying three changes that will be discussed in \ref{sec:comparison}.
