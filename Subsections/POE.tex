% A Phylogenetic, Ontogenetic, and Epigenetic View of Bio-Inspired Hardware Systems

As a final category of evolvable systems, inspired by life on Earth and the natural processes of living organisms, \emph{bio-inspired} hardware systems have evolved. \cite{poe} introduces the POE model, that classifies bio-inspired systems according to three axes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Phylogeny, where evolvable hardware can be found.
	\item Ontogeny, where systems have the ability to self-repair as the main goal of ontogeny is (cell) growth or construction.
	\item Epigenesis, which is more software-based.
\end{itemize}

By looking at these biological phenomena, researchers can be inspired when developing evolvable hardware systems.
