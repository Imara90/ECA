% The Erlangen Slot Machine: A Dynamically Reconfigurable FPGA-based Computer

[detailed technical discussion follow later] 

The Erlangen Slot Machine from \cite{erlangen} tackles the three major limitations of the Virtex-II FPGA produced by Xilinx. A pipelined data flow architecture has been used, replacing the finite state machine by a MicroBlaze microcontroller and employing a data crossbar between plug-ins. Providing  a new architecture to avoid the current physical problems of reconfigurable FPGAs, a new inter-module communication concept, as well as an intelligent module reconfiguration management has made the ESM an alternative for the Xilinx FPGAs.
