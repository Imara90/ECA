% The Erlangen Slot Machine: A Dynamically Reconfigurable FPGA-based Computer
\label{sec:erlangen}
FPGAs are commonly used device for implementing the reconfigurable architecture of evolvable systems, especially Virtex FPGAs produced by Xilinx. These devices have some drawbacks. The \emph{Erlangen Slot Machine (ESM)} from \cite{erlangen} tackles the three major limitations of the Virtex-II FPGA. A pipelined data flow architecture has been used, replacing the finite state machine by a MicroBlaze microcontroller and employing a data crossbar between plug-ins. Providing a new architecture to avoid the current physical problems of reconfigurable FPGAs, a new inter-module communication concept, as well as an intelligent module reconfiguration management has made the ESM an alternative for the Virtex FPGAs.
