\cite{selfaware} presents an implementation of a FPGA-based self-aware adaptive computing system which blends several software based techniques such as \emph{monitoring, decision making} and \emph{self-adaptation}. This system is built on top of a heterogeneous architecture enabling and utilizing the effectiveness of these systems. The operating system on top enables performance monitoring and can take actions involving software and hardware adaptation. The \emph{application Heartbeats} is used to asses and monitor performance and progress and the \emph{Implementation Switch Service} is used to switch between different implementations of the same functionality using a heuristic based decision mechanism. 

Based on constraints such as available resources and input data size and type the operating system chooses the best implementation at run-time. This decision is based on the \emph{observe-decide-act (ODA) loop}. Given certain performance goals these loops \emph{observe} the current state, \epmh{decide} upon an action and \emph{acts} accordingly as will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:selfawareness}, \ref{sec:decisions} and \ref{sec:selfadapting}.

The Heartbeats application is a monitoring application which makes it possible to assert performance goals as heart-rate windows delimited by a minimum and maximum performance, or \emph{heart-rate} \cite{evolvable}. The Heartbeats API is made of small straightforward functions and allows declaring performance goals. Software components first have to register, specifying parameters such as minimum and maxmim heart-reate, size of the windows of observation and history buffers \cite{selfaware}. The application then updates the progress of the execution calling the function that signifies a heartbeat \cite{evolvable}.

The implementation switch service presented in \cite{selfaware} inspired by the \emph{hot-swap mechanism} is fundamental for the system to switch between different implementations of the same functionality at run-time. Since threads can access data structures concurrently and data structures can differ for different implementations, \cite{selfaware} proposes a framework to account for these shortcomings in the hot-swap mechanism.  This framework is divided in three sub-phases: a prior phase representing the common work scenario, a transfer phase that blocks new requests in order to reach a quiescent state, translated to fit another data structure and a post phase in which the blocked and new requests are allowed to proceed.

%[SMARTLOCKS PAPER] presents a combination of the Heartbeats application in cooperating with other frameworks. Smartlocks is a spinlock library that will adapt its internal implementations based on defined goals during run-time using heurstics as discussed in subsection \ref{sec:decisions} and machine learning.

%\cite{reconfigurable} dscusses using adaptive programming in situations where input changes lead to relatively small output changes. They present a hardware-software codesign paradigm that develops a new performance model and associated evaluation metrics to differentiate between various levels of performance across different portions of software modules. Incoorporating this into a codesign environment increases the flexibility of the system.
