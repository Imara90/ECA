\subsection{Monitoring techniques}
\label{sec:selfawareness}
The heartbeats application as discussed in section \cite{sec:selfaware} is a technique used for monitoring. A framework like this is particularly convenient because it allows to automatically update all information about the global heart-rate which is then made available to external observers, such as decision making applcations. However it introduces an average overhead of 3,52\% due to system calls in order to initialize its data structures and updating the global heart rate \cite{selfaware}.
