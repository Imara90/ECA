\section{Analysis of techniques}
\label{sec:technique}

This section provides an overview of techniques that are used in current research to create evolvable hardware implementations of evolvable systems. To create such a system, the system has to be self-aware, able to make decisions, self-adapting and the hardware has to support a certain amount of reconfiguration. In section \ref{sec:proposition} the overall best combination will be presented, utlizing the flexibility of software and the speed of hardware.
