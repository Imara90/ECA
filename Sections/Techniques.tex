\section{Analysis of techniques}
\label{sec:technique}
Reconfiguration capabilities and hardware-software codesign techniques are elements of a complex scenario. This ssection will discuss and analyze these capabilities and techniques seperately. To create such a self-adaptive autonomic system, the system has to be self-aware, able to make decisions, self-adapting and the hardware has to support a certain amount of reconfiguration. In section \ref{sec:proposition} the overall best combination will be presented, utlizing the flexibility of software and the speed of hardware.
