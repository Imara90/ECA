\section{Introduction}

In the past few years, the term evolvable hardware (EHW) has arised. A lot of research has already been done on this new field of electronics, which uses evolutionary algorithms (EA) in order to eliminate manual engineering. Reconfigurable hardware, artificial intelligence, fault tolerance and autonomous systems are brought together, enabling the system to change its architecture and behaviour dynamically and autonomously by interacting with its environment. By defining a specific goal or task, the system is programmed to evolve in real-time towards finding an implementation. It continues research on self-aware systems, machine learning and is often linked to bio-inspired hardware systems. 

This paper will introduce several proposed architectures for hardware implementation of evolvable systems in section \ref{sec:discussion}. The separate techniques used in order to accomplish these implementations are then isolated and discussed in section \ref{sec:technique}. Section \ref{sec:proposition} proposes the architecture that is in our opinion the best hardware implementation possible given the current techniques. A quantative substantiation, comparing the test results of the discussed papers, is given in section \ref{sec:related}. Finally, our literature study will be wrapped up by a conclusion in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
