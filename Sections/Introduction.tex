In the past few years, the term \emph{evolvable hardware (EHW)} has arised. A lot of research has been done in this new field of electronics, which utilizes \emph{evolutionary algorithms (EA)} and \emph{self-adaptive techniques}  in order to eliminate manual engineering. Reconfigurable hardware, artificial intelligence, fault tolerance and autonomous systems are brought together, enabling the system to change its architecture and behaviour dynamically and autonomously based on its internal state and its environment. By defining a specific goal or task, the system is programmed to evolve in real-time towards an implementation. It continues research on self-aware systems, machine learning and is often linked to bio-inspired hardware systems. 

This paper will introduce several proposed architectures for hardware implementation of evolvable systems in Section \ref{sec:discussion}. Section \ref{sec:technique} will then present the techniques that are used in order to accomplish these implementations. Section \ref{sec:proposition} proposes the system design that is in our opinion the best hardware implementation possible given the current techniques. This design will be critically analyzed using the proposed designs presented in the discussed papers in Section \ref{sec:related}. Finally, our literature study will be wrapped up by a conclusion in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
