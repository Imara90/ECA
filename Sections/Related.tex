%Smartlocks is a spinlock library that adapts its internal implementation during execution using heuristics and machine learning. It optimizes towards a user-defined goal, programmed using the application heartbeats framework, which may relate to performance, power, problem-specific criteria or combinations. \cite{reconfigurable}
