% Proposition of a evolvable system on a reconfigurable architecture

\section{Proposed Adaptive System Design}
\label{sec:proposition}

Given all these techniques, the question rises which of them could become promising when being combined with each other. In this section, a design is being proposed mixing and matching the previous techiques based on their advantages and drawbacks. By doing this, we first look at the hardware implementations, since these are responsible for the physical limitations. Afterwards, several software techniques are considered in order to add the evolvable behaviour to the system.
