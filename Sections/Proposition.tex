% Proposition of a evolvable system on a reconfigurable architecture

\section{Proposed Adaptive System Design}
\label{sec:proposition}

As stated in Section \ref{sec:codesign} a co-designed architecture is most promising when designing an evolvable system on a heterogeneous architecture. In this section, a design is being proposed mixing and matching the previous techiques based on their advantages and drawbacks.
