\section{Discussion of the Different Papers}

[introduction to discussions and seperation of the topics, maybe seperate hardware from software solution from these papers?]
[Give some small introduction to each paper in 3 sentences and then maximum of 15 for every paper]

Considerable research has already been done in order to efficiently accelerate hardware while still maintaining virtually unlimited adaptability. Software techniques in autonomic computing systems such as hot-swapping and data clustering are discussed in \cite{survey}. These self-aware systems can adapt their behavior on FPGA-based system as discussed in \cite{selfaware}.
