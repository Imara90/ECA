\section{Discussion of the Different Papers}

\emph{[introduction to discussions and seperation of the topics, maybe seperate hardware from software solution from these papers?]
[Give some small introduction to each paper in 3 sentences and then maximum of 15 for every paper]}

Considerable research has already been done in order to efficiently accelerate hardware while still maintaining virtually unlimited adaptability. 
Software techniques in autonomic computing systems such as hot-swapping and data clustering are discussed in \cite{survey}. 
These self-aware systems can adapt their behavior on FPGA-based system as discussed in \cite{selfaware}.
Other approaches start with a FPGA-based architecture with a reconfigurable core \cite{drp},  added programming schemes and new cell structures \cite{virtex4}, \cite{erlangen} or even bio-inspired hardware using the POE-model \cite{poe}.
More recent papers put effort a combined approach by either implementing autonomic systems on reconfigurable architectures \cite{reconfigurable} or creating evolvable systems via self-aware applications \cite{evolvable}.
