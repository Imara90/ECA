\section{Discussion of the Different Papers}
\label{sec:discussion}
Considerable research has already been done in order to efficiently accelerate hardware while still maintaining virtually unlimited adaptability. Software techniques in autonomic computing systems such as hot-swapping and data clustering are discussed in \cite{survey}. \cite{selfaware} proposes a self-aware system able to adapt the behavior of FPGA-based systems.
Other approaches start with a FPGA-based architecture with a reconfigurable core \cite{PDR}, added programming schemes and new cell structures as seen in \cite{virtex4} and \cite{erlangen} or even bio-inspired hardware using the POE-model \cite{poe} as discussed in Section \ref{sec:related}.
More recent papers put effort in a combined approach by either implementing autonomic systems on reconfigurable architectures \cite{reconfigurable} or creating evolvable systems via self-aware applications \cite{evolvable}. In this section software based designs, hardware based designs are co-designs are discussed.
