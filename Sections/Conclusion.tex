% Conclusion and Future Challenges

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, a hardware implementation of an evolvable system is proposed. The two-dimensional reconfigurable architecture using systolic arrays of processing elements enabling partial dynamically reconfiguration and its co-designed evolvable framework supporting the HeartBeats monitoring application an empirical model based decision engine and a hot-swap inspired self-adapting framework is based on a critical analysis of current research in autonomic and evolvable systems on heterogeneous architectures. 

The proposed design was derived after discussing current research in the field of evolvable systems and heterogeneous architectures and extracting the techniques that are utilized. Although a deeper understanding is given into the world of autonomic systems, future work would have to invest in providing an analytical understanding. Proposed future work would be running benchmarks for these systems so the techniques that were used can be compared seperately and in co-design. 

This paper provides a deeper understanding into co-design of hardware and software that is becoming increasingly important considering the current increase in system complexity and size.
