% what is evolvable
Evolvable systems exploiting self-adaptive techniques are self-configuring and self-optimizing systems capable of changing their operations to meet the given performance goals by modifying either the underlying heterogeneous architecture, the operating system and the self-adaptive applications. \cite{evolvable}
Meeting efficiency and accuracy constraints is getting more and more difficult , mainly because of the exponential increase of interactions among systems and the environments in which the systems are required to work. 

% techniques used
The monitoring process is central to self-adaptive systems and is done by the application HeartBeats. 
Using machine learning, one can enhance synchronization techniques. K32 is a modern object-oriented operating system that responds to changing and challenging environments adapting its operations. It supports on line reconfiguration of functionalities by interposition, hot-swap and dynamic update. \cite{evolvable}

%The operating systems chooses at run-time among a set of possible implementations according %to the criteria. This decision is based on the Observe-decide-act. The need for this dynamic %choice between available implementations is give by the fact that the system is live and %lives in an unpredictable environment. \cite{selfaware}

%e explanation of autonomic 
The autonomic concept is inpired by the human body's nervous system. This system is known to be adapt to environment aware and capable of adapting to this, but also be able to repair minor physical damage. An autonomic system is stated to contain all these properties, also known as self-properties: \emph{self-managing, self-protecting, self-healing} and \emph{self-optimizing} \cite{autonomic}.
